                <h3>Scoop Marketplace: Website for a small business</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Store overview</strong>: Scoop Marketplace is a zero-waste grocery store orginally located in Seattle, now in Kirkland. The store lets customers bring their reusable containers to scoop package-free food, home goods, and personal care products in their desire amount. Packaged products are also available in compostable or reusable packaging.</li>
                    <li><strong>Project overview</strong>: I was a founding member of Scoop Marketplace with a strong interest in low-waste living and sustainability. Working at Scoop was inspiring, it also proved that sustainable living has gained much more momentum than ever before. I was a part of building the brand online presence from the ground up. With budget limitation as a startup, I optimized the existing resources to the best of my ability.</li>

                <ul>
                <li><strong>Challenge</strong>: At that time, only laptop and mobile views were available to customize on Wix, not including tablet view. But it didn't automatically create the responsive design, supposedly due to the drag-and-drop function.</li>
                <li><strong>Solution</strong>: Manually developed the mobile responsive design for every single page.</li>
                </ul>
